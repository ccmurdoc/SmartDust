# SmartDust
Software component to Smart Dust. Smartdust is a system of many tiny microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) such as sensors, robots, or other devices, that can detect, for example, light, temperature, vibration, magnetism, or chemicals. 

This was a final semester project that simulates the embedded system and network sensing of smart dust.
